.Nd fast filename search on HFS+ and APFS volumes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op  -v volume
.Ar search_string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
does a fast filename search on HFS+ and APFS volumes. Searching takes place
at the driver level using the file system catalog via the low-level searchfs()
function. This means the volume's entire directory tree can be scanned much
faster than with a standard recursive filename search.
.Pp
Paths of files with names containing search_string are printed to STDOUT, one
path per line. Only case-insensitive search is supported at this time.
.Pp
The following flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl v, -volume
Specify volume to search. Default is the root file system at /
.It Fl d, -dirs-only
Print only matching directories
.It Fl f, -files-only
Print only matching files
.It Fl e, -exact-match-only
Print only exact matches
.It Fl h, -help
Print usage and exit
