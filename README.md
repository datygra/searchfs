`searchfs` is a macOS command line tool to quickly search by filename on HFS+ and APFS volumes. Searching takes place at the driver level using the file system catalog. This means the volume's entire directory tree can be scanned much faster than with a standard recursive filename search using `find`.  Due to limitations in the underlying Darwin API, only case-insensitive filename matching is supported at this time.

## Performance

According to my benchmarks, `searchfs` runs about 35-40% faster than `find` under typical conditions.

The following are benchmark results on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro with an Apple-supplied 512 GB SSD running an APFS file system containing about 2 million files:

### searchfs
```shell
$ time searchfs -v / "something"
0,01s user 33,15s system 32% cpu 1:41,59 total
```
### /usr/bin/find
```shell
$ time find / -name "*something*"
9,53s user 67,64s system 49% cpu 2:37,39 total
```

Although I have yet to test this, `searchfs` is likely to be even faster relative to `find` on hard disk drives, which have higher seek times.

## History

Apple added file system catalog search to Mac OS with the introduction of the Hiearchical File System (HFS) in 1985. HFS replaced the previous flat table structure in the old MFS file system with a catalog file using a B-tree structure. Unlike Windows' FAT file system, HFS (and later, HFS+) thus arranged the entire directory tree into one large file on the disk, with interlinked nodes that did not match the hierarchical folder structure. This meant that volumes could be searched very quickly regardless of size.

The Classic Mac OS exposed this functionality via the FSCatalogSearch() function, which iterated efficiently over the nodes, thus minimizing disk seek times. In the pre-SSD era, this gave the Mac a significant performance advantage over Windows when it came to full-volume search. For a long time, FSCatalogSearch continued to be available in Mac OS X / macOS via the Carbon APIs but it has now been deprecated and does not support APFS, Apple's new file system.

However, catalog search for both HFS+ and APFS remains available in Darwin's low-level system libraries via the [searchfs()](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/2/searchfs/) function. The `searchfs` program makes use of this function.
