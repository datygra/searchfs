`searchfs` is a macOS command line tool to quickly search by filename on HFS+ and APFS volumes. Searching takes place at the driver level using the file system catalog. This means the volume's entire directory tree can be scanned much faster than with a standard recursive filename search using `/usr/bin/find`.  Currently only supports case-insensitive search.
